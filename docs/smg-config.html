<h2 id="configuration-overview">Configuration overview</h2>
<p>SMG uses <a href="http://yaml.org/">yaml</a> for its configuration file format. Yaml is flexible and it is both easy to read and write.</p>
<p>By default SMG will look for a file named <strong>/etc/smg/config.yml</strong> and read its configuration from there. That file name can be changed in the <em>conf/application.conf</em> file inside the SMG installation dir, if desired.</p>
<p>All config items are defined as a list. I.e. the top-level yaml structure for a config file must be a list (SMG will fail to parse it otherwise). This basically means that every object definition starts with a dash at the beggining of a line, e.g.:</p>
<pre>
...

- $rrd_dir: smgrrd
- $include: /path/to/conf/*.yml
...

- id: some.rrd.object
  ...

...

- id: ^some.index.object
  ...

...
</pre>
<p>Note that ordering matters in general - SMG will try to preserve the order of the graphs to be displayed to match the order in which the objects were defined.</p>
<p>Apart from <a href="#globals">global variables</a> which are in the form of “- $name: value” pairs, SMG has several types of structured objects. These can be indicated by their “type” property or for some - it can be inferred by the first character of the object id: ‘+’ indicating an <a href="#rrd-agg-objects">Aggregate object</a>, ‘^’ - an <a href="#indexes">Index</a>, and ‘~’ - a <a href="#hindexes">Hidden index</a>. An object with no type and none of the special id prefix characters is assumed to be a <a href="#rrd-objects">RRD</a> or a <a href="#view-objects">Graph</a> object. So normally an object definition would look like:</p>
<pre>
# id-prefix-typed objects - the (possibly prefixed) id
# is just a named property
- id: object.id
  ...
- id: +agg.object.id
  ...

# explicitly-typed objects have the type and id as
# named properties
- type: object_type
  id: ...
  ...
</pre>
<p>Normally the top-level config file would only contain globals including a bunch of “- $include: …” definitions and the actual config files defining these objects would be drop-in files in sub-directories. For example the SMG container image already bundles an /etc/smg/config.yml file which in turn includes a bunch of common directories/globs including <strong>/etc/smg/conf.d/*.yml</strong> (where one can drop yml files, which in turn can also include other dirs/globs) and <strong>/opt/smg/data/conf/autoconf-private.d/*.yml</strong> (where by default the Autoconf plugin will drop and remove its per-target template outputs)</p>
<h3 id="old-deprecated-format">Old (deprecated) format</h3>
<p>A side note is that originally all object types would be defined using key -&gt; (prop1 -&gt; value1, …) syntax where the above would look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
 # id-prefix-typed objects - key is the (possibly
 # prefixed) id
 - object.id:
     ...
 - +agg.object.id:
     ...

 # explicitly-typed objects - key is the type
 # (these used to be special cases of globals)
 - $object_type:
     id: ...
     ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>While now deprecated, this syntax is still suported and can be seen in older config templates and/or examples.</p>
<p><a name="rrd-objects" /></p>
<h2 id="rrd-objects">RRD objects</h2>
<p>RRD objects usually represent the majority of the SMG config. These define a rrd file to be updated, its structure, the interval on which we want to update it and the command to use to retrieve the values to update. A rrd object is represented by a yaml structure which could look like this:</p>
<pre>
- id: host.localhost.sysload                            # rrd object id
  command: "smgscripts/mac_localhost_sysload.sh"        # mandatory command outputting values
  timeout: 30                                           # optional - fetch command timeout, default 30
  title: "Localhost sysload (1/5/15 min)"               # optional title - object id will be used if no title is present
  interval: 60                                          # optional - default is 60
  data_delay: 0                                         # optional - default 0
  delay: 0.0                                            # optional - default 0.0
  rrd_type: GAUGE                                       # optional - default is GAUGE. Can be COUNTER etc (check rrdtool docs)
  rrd_init_source: "/path/to/existing/file.rrd"         # optional - if defined SMG will pass --source <val> to rrdtool create
  stack: false                                          # optional - stack graph lines if true, default - false
  pre_fetch: some_pf_id                                 # optional - specify pre_fetch command id.
  notify-fail: mail-asen,notif-pd                       # optional - sent command failures to these recipients (see notify- conf below)
  labels:                                               # optional - arbitrary map of key/valu labels, useful for
    foo: bar                                            #            filtering and grouping by
  vars:                                                 # mandatory list of all variables to graph
    - label: sl1min                                     # the variable label.
      min: 0                                            # optional - min accepted rrd value, default 0
      max: 1000                                         # optional - max accepted rrd value, default U (unlimmited)
      maxy: 1005                                        # optional - use this te set upper limit on the displayed graph (similar to maxy index option)
      mu: "lavg"                                        # optional - measurement units, default - empty string
      lt: "LINE1"                                       # optional - line type, default is LINE1
      alert-warn-gt: 8                                  # optional - monitoring thresholds, details below
    - label: sl5min                                     # another variable def
    - label: sl15min                                    # a 3d variable def
</pre>
<p>Most properties are optional except:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>object id</strong> - in the old syntax that would be the key after the dash defining the start of the object, <em>host.localhost.sysload</em> in the example. The new syntax explicitly sets the id key/value. It must be unique for the local SMG instance and consist only of alpha-numeric characters and the ‘_’, ‘-’ and ‘.’ symbols. By convention, ids should be defined like <strong>&lt;class&gt;.&lt;subclass&gt;[.&lt;subclass&gt;...].&lt;object&gt;</strong>, e.g. <em>host.o1.cpu</em> or <em>host.o1.diskused.var</em>. Following that convention is not enforced by SMG but using it helps it discover “automatic indexes” and also makes it much easier to write <a href="#indexes">index (filter) definitions</a> and in general - navigate around SMG.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>command</strong>: is a mandatory property and its value must be a system or <a href="#plugins-cc">plugin</a> command (string) which (retrieves and) outputs the numeric values we want tracked, each on a separate line. Note that SMG only cares about the first N lines of the output (where N is the number of vars, see below) from the script and will ignore excess lines (this is for compatibility with mrtg scripts which output uptime and hostname after values). If the command ouptuts less lines than expected or these are not numeric values, an error will be generated and NaN values will be recorded in the RRD file time series.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="obj-vars"></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>vars</strong>: - mandatory list of yaml objects (string -&gt; string maps). The number and order of var objects determines the rrd structure and how many lines of output from the external <em>command</em> will be considered. Each var itself supports the following properties where only label is mandatory (technically - even label is not mandatory but at least one key -&gt; value must be present):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>label</strong>: - the label to use for this variable in the graph legend</p></li>
<li><p><strong>mu</strong>: (“measurement units”) - what string to display after the number (avg/max etc) values in the graph legend, e.g. “bps” (for bits per secod). rrdtool (and thus SMG) will automatically use scale modifiers like M (for mega-), m (for milli-) etc. so bps would become Mbps for megabits per second.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>min</strong>: (default <em>0</em>) - minimal accepted rrd value. Values below that will be ignored and NaN will be recorded. Set to <em>U</em> if you want to record negatve values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>max</strong>: (default <em>U</em> for unlimited) - maximal accepted rrd value. Values above that will be ignored and NaN will be recorded instead. This is rarely needed for GAUGE type graphs but is almost <strong>always</strong> needed for COUNTER graphs. rrdtool will use the max value to detect counter overflows where the delta is usually resulting in a huge integer (if unsigned, otherwise - negative) value. If that value is above the max rrdtool will ignore it and record a NaN. Use the DERIVE type (with the default min=0) to always ignore counter overflows (negative values).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>maxy</strong>: (default <em>None</em> - auto scaling) - set the upper limit on the displayed graph.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>lt</strong>: (line type, default is <em>LINE1</em>) - the line type to use when graphing. Check rrdtool documentation for supported line types (e.g. AREA etc).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="obj-vars-cdef"></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>cdef</strong>: - one can provide a rrdtool cdef / <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/tut/rpntutorial.en.html">RPN expression</a> and SMG would graph the result of that expression instead of the original value. Inside the expression the actual rrd value can be referenced using the special ‘<em>$ds</em>’ string. For example to multiply the actual RRD value by 8 before graphing one would use the following cdef value: _"$ds,8,*"_. This specific example is useful when graphing network traffic counters which are reported in bytes but we prefer to have them graphed in bits (per second)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>alert-*</strong>: - these are multiple properties which define monitoring alert thresholds (e.g. alert-wart-gt, alert-crit-lt, etc.) check <a href="#monitoring">monitoring config</a> for details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>notify-*</strong>: - these are multiple properties which define monitoring alert notifications. Check <a href="#monitoring">monitoring config</a> for details.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that changing the number of vars when the rrd object already exists is not supported and will cause update errors, and changing their order will result in messed up data. It is still possible to make such a change outside SMG using rrdtool though.</p>
<p>The following properties are all optional.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>interval</strong>: - (default - <em>60</em> seconds) - every rrd object has a an interval associated with it - determining how often the data will be retrieved from the monitored service and updated in the RRD file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>data_delay</strong> - (default - <em>0</em> seconds) - sometimes services report their data with certain delay (e.g. a CDN API may report the traffic used with 15 min delay). Set that value to the number of seconds data is delayed with and on update SMG will subtract that many seconds from the fetch/update timestamp. This was named <strong>dataDelay</strong> in older versions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>delay</strong> - (default - <em>0.0</em> seconds) - If an object has a delay specified its fetch command will not run immediately when its turn comes but after the specified amount of seconds. If a negative delay is specified the command will be run with a random delay between 0 and (interval - abs(delay)) seconds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>title</strong>: - free form text description of the object. If not specified, the object id will be used as a title.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>rrd_type</strong>: (default - GAUGE) - can be COUNTER, DERIVE etc, check rrdtool docs for other options. Note that originally SMG used rrdType for this property which is inconsistent with the rest. SMG will still try to read rrdType if rrd_type is not present, for backwards compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>rrd_init_source</strong>: (no default) - if defined SMG will pass –source <em>val</em> to rrdtool create. This can be used to rebuild some rrd using different step/RRAs etc. E.g. update the conf specifying rrd_init_source: object.id.old, then rename the actual rrd file from object.id.rrd to object.id.old. On the next run SMG will re-create the rrd using the newly specified config and populate the data from the pre-existing values. Check rrdtool docs for more information and caveats (Note: this feature requires recent rrdtool version supporting the –source option, 1.5.5+ is known to work)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stack</strong>: (default - false) - if set to true - stack graph lines on top of each other.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>pre_fetch</strong>: (default - None) - specify a <a href="#pre_fetch">$pre_fetch</a> command id to execute before this object command will be run.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>rra</strong>: (default - None) - specify a <a href="#rra_def">rra_def id</a> to use for this object. By default SMG will pick one based on object interval.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>notify-fail</strong>: - This specifies a <a href="#notify-command">notification command</a> to execute when the object fetch command fails. Check <a href="#monitoring">monitoring config</a> for details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>labels</strong>: (default - empty map) - a map of key/vaule pairs useful for filtering and grouping by.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="pre_fetch" /></p>
<h2 id="pre-fetch-command-objects">Pre-fetch command objects</h2>
<p>As explained in the <a href="smg.html#concepts-pre_fetch">concepts overview</a> SMG RRD objects can specify a pre_fetch command to execute before their own command gets executed (for every interval run). That way multiple objects can be updated from given source (e.g. host/service) while hitting it only once per interval. Pre_fetch itself can have another pre_fetch defined as a parent and one can form command trees to be run top-to-bottom (stopping on failure).</p>
<p>Note that the “run tree” defined in this way must not have cycles which can be created in theory by circularly pointing pre_fetch parents to each other (possibly via other ones). Currently SMG will reject the config update if circular parent depenencies in the run-tree are detected (detection is simply having a hard limit of max 10 parent levels when constructing the run trees).</p>
<p>Here are two example pre_fetch definitions, one referencing the other as a parent:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>

    - type: pre_fetch
      desc: "check if localhost is up"
      id: host.host1.up
      command: "ping -c 1 host1 >/dev/null"
      notify-fail: mail-asen, notif-pd
      child_conc: 2
      ignorets: true
      timeout: 5

    - type: pre_fetch
      id: host.host1.snmp.vals
      command: "snmp_get.sh o1 laLoad.1 laLoad.2 ssCpuRawUser.0 ssCpuRawNice.0 ..."
      pre_fetch: host.host1.up
      pass_data: true
      timeout: 30
      delay: 5.5
</pre>
<p>Old (deprecated) syntax - using “$pre_fetch:” instead of “type: pre_fetch”:</p>
<pre>

    - $pre_fetch:
      id: host.host1.up
      ...

</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>A pre_fetch defines an unique <strong>id</strong> and a <strong>command</strong> to execute, together with an optional <strong>timeout</strong> for the command (30 seconds by default) and an optional “parent” pre_fetch id.</p>
<p>If a <strong>pass_data</strong> property is defined and is set to true the stdout of the command will be passed to all child commands as stdin.</p>
<p>By default SMG will use the timestamp of the top-level pre-fetch for RRD updates. One can set the <strong>ignorets</strong> property to ignore the timstamp of the pre-fetch and use the first child timestamp which doesn’t have that property.</p>
<p>In addition pre_fetch can have a <strong>child_conc</strong> property (default 1 if not specified) which determines how many threads can execute this pre-fetch child pre-fetches (but not object commands which are always parallelized).</p>
<p>One can also specify a <strong>delay</strong> expressed as a floating point value in seconds. This will cause the command (and it children) to be executed with a delay according to the specified number of seconds. If a negative delay is specified the command will be run with a random delay between 0 and (interval - abs(delay)) seconds.</p>
<p>Pre fetch also supports <strong>notify-fail</strong> - to override alert recipients for failure and also <strong>notify-disable</strong>, <strong>notify-backoff</strong> etc. (check <a href="#monitoring">monitoring config</a> for details).</p>
<p><a name="rrd-agg-objects" /></p>
<h2 id="aggregate-rrd-objects">Aggregate RRD objects</h2>
<p>In addition to the “regular” RRD Objects described above, one can define “aggregate” RRD Objects. Simiar to the aggregate functions which can be applied on multiple View objects, the aggrgeate RRD objects represent values produced by applying an aggregate function (SUM, AVG, etc, also a special RPN op) to a set of update objects. The resulting value is then updated in a RRD file and the object also represents a View object subject to display and view aggregation functions. An aggrgegate RRD object is defined by prepending a ‘+’ to the object id. Example:</p>
<pre>
- id: +agg.hosts.sysload                                # aggregate rrd object id, must start with + char
  op: AVG                                               # mandatory aggregate function to apply
  ids:                                                  # list of object ids, either that or a filter must be specified
    - host.host1.sysload                                # regular rrd object id, currently must be defined before this object in the config
    - host.host2.sysload                                # regular rrd object id, currently must be defined before this object in the config
  interval: 60                                          # optional - default is the interval of the first object listed in the ids list
  title: "Localhost sysload (1/5/15 min)"               # optional title - object id will be used if no title is present
  rrd_type: GAUGE                                       # optional - if not set, the rrd_type of the first object will be used
  rrd_init_source: "/path/to/existing/file.rrd"         # optional - if defined SMG will pass --source <val> to rrdtool create
  stack: false                                          # optional - stack graph lines if true, default - false
  notify-fail: mail-asen,notif-pd                       # optional - sent command failures to these recipients (see notify- conf below)
  labels:                                               # optional - arbitrary map of key/value labels, useful for filtering
    foo: bar                                            #            and grouping by
  vars:                                                 # optional list of all variables to graph. If not set the first object vars list will be used.
    - label: sl1min                                     # the variable label.
      min: 0                                            # optional - min accepted rrd value, default 0
      max: 1000                                         # optional - max accepted rrd value, default U (unlimmited)
      mu: "lavg"                                        # optional - measurement units, default - empty string
      lt: "LINE1"                                       # optional - line type, default is LINE1
      alert-warn-gt: 8                                  # optional - monitoring thresholds, details below
    - label: sl5min                                     # another variable def
    - label: sl15min                                    # a 3d variable def
  labels:                                               # optional - object labels, useful for filtering and grouping by
    foo: bar
</pre>
<p>As mentioned in the yaml comments above, some of the properties of the aggregate object will be assumed from the first object vars list, unless explicitly defined. It is up to the config to ensure that the list of objects to aggregate is compatible (and meaningful).</p>
<p>There is one additional aggregate operation supported by aggregate objects which is currently not supported by the UI - the RPN:<em>expression</em> op. The syntax for this is like “op: RPN:$ds0,$ds1,+”. That would apply the rpn operation on each of the vars of the list of objects where ds0 would map to the first object value, ds1 to the second one and so on.</p>
<p>As of v1.4+ SMG also supports supplying <em>filter</em> property instead of ids list (technically - it is possible to use and combine both). The filter property value is a map representing a standard (regex-based) SMG Filter which in turn is applied at config generation time to the entire list of RRD objects defined in the config. Note that this filter can only work with local objects.</p>
<p><a name="view-objects" /></p>
<h2 id="view-graph-objects">View (Graph) objects</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="smg.html#concepts-view-objects">concepts overview</a> every RRD object is implicitly also a View object. Additional View objects can be defined in the configuration by referencing existing RRD objects too. These have two main purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>to be able to graph only a subset of the RRD object vars and/or change their order by specifying the graphed vars as a list of indexes in the RRD object vars (see <a href="#gv">gv</a> below). Here is an example configuration for such an object (this will graph only the second var from the list of the referenced object vars).</li>
</ul>
<pre>
    - host.localhost.sysload.5m:                             # View object id
      title: "Localhost sysload - 5min only"                 # optional title - object id will be used if no title is present
      ref: host.localhost.sysload                            # object id of an already defined rrd object
      stack: false                                           # optional - stack graph lines if true, default - false
      gv:                                                    # a list of integers ("graph vars")
        - 1                                                  # index in ref object vars list
</pre>
<p>Note that a special use case of a view object can be to simply define an alias (another object id) for an existing object, possibly to simplify filtering and grouping of somehow related objects with unrelated IDs and labels.</p>
<ul>
<li>to be able to graph a value calculated from the RRD object’s values using <a href="#cdef_vars">cdef_vars</a>. Here is an example definition of such an object which is referencing another object with 2 vars (not visible here) - one for varnish req/sec and the other for varnish cache hit/sec. The View object below defines a single cdef var(line) calculating its values by evaluating the cdef expression (calculating cache hit % in this case) <a href="#cdef_vars-cdef">explained below</a></li>
</ul>
<pre>
    - host.va1.varnishstat.hitperc:
      title: "va1 - varnishstat: cache_hit/client_req %"
      ref: host.va.varnishstat.client_req_hitttl
      cdef_vars:
        - label: "hitperc"
          mu: "%"
          cdef: "$ds1,100,*,$ds0,/"
</pre>
<p>One should not set both gv and cdef_vars on the same View object. If one does that the gv values will be ignored. Note that technically it is possible to do what gv does using just cdef_vars except that gv provides a simpler way to just select a subset or reorder graph lines.</p>
<p>View objects support the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the <strong>object id</strong>: This is the unique object view id (must not conflict with other view or rrd objects). Check <a href="#rrd-objects">RRD Objects</a> for more info on allowed and good object ids.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ref</strong>: mandatory reference (string) to a RRD object id</p></li>
<li><p><strong>title</strong>: - free form text description of the object. If not specified, the ref object title will be used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>labels</strong>: - key/value pairs useful for filtering and grouping.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="gv" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>gv</strong> (graph vars) - This is a list of integers representing 0-based indexes in the ref object <a href="#obj-vars">vars</a> list. For example if the ref object has 3 vars and we want to graph the third and first in that order we would use the following gv definition:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
    ...
    gv:
      - 2
      - 0
</pre>
<p><a name="cdef_vars" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>cdef_vars</strong> - this defines a list of variables very similar to the referenced RRD object <a href="#obj-vars">vars</a>. It supports the same properties and the main difference is how the <a name="cdef_vars-cdef" /> <strong>cdef</strong> property is treated. On a RRD object <a href="#obj-vars-cdef">cdef</a> can only reference the variable its defined on by using the <em>$ds</em> special string. In cdef_vars we can reference all vars in the ref RRD object in a single <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/tut/rpntutorial.en.html">RPN expression</a> and produce a single graph line from multiple vars. The ref object variables are referenced in the expression by their 0-based index with $ds prefix - <em>$ds0</em>, <em>$ds1</em>, <em>$ds2</em> etc. In the above example we have</li>
</ul>
<pre>
      ...
      cdef_vars:
          ...
          cdef: "$ds1,100,*,$ds0,/"
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The cdef expression can be translated as (form right to left): <em>Divide the value of ( the product of the 2nd (ds1) var with 100 ) by the value of the 1st (ds0) var</em>. Or <em>ds1 * 100 / ds0</em> in more conventional notation. In our case the ds0 represents “requests/sec” and ds1 represents “cache hits/sec”. So that expression is calculating the cache hit % (from all requests). Rddtool has great documentation on <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/tut/rpntutorial.en.html">RPN expressions</a> and I strongly recommend reading that for anyone who wants to write cdef expressions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="interval-definitions">Interval definitions</h2>
<p><a name="interval_def" /></p>
<p>The interval_def object defines the behavior of the thread pool associated with given poll interval. It has a mandatory <strong>interval</strong> property specifying the interval (in seconds) for which this applies and optional <strong>threads</strong> property specifying max number of threads (default is 4 and if set to 0 it will be dynamically set to the number of cpu cores available) and and a <strong>pool</strong> property specifying the type of thread pool - one of FIXED (default) and WORK_STEALING. Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
    - type: interval_def
      interval: 60
      threads: 20
      pool: FIXED

    - type: interval_def
      interval: 200
      threads: 0 # will use num cpu cores
      pool: WORK_STEALING

Old (deprecated) syntax:

    - $interval_def:
      interval: 60
      ...

</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that these are optional - smg will assume some sane defaults if they are omitted but depending on the workload chances are that some tuning of the number of threads doing the polling may be needed.</p>
<p><a name="indexes" /></p>
<h2 id="indexes">Indexes</h2>
<p>In SMG an “index” represents a named “filter” which can be used to identify and display a group of graphs together. Also an index can define a parent and child indexes, so one can define a tree-like navigational structure using indexes. If an index does not have a parent index it is considered a “top-level” index. All top-level indexes are displayed on the SMG main page (by remote), together with their first-level child indexes.</p>
<p>Index objects are defined in the yaml along with the RRD and View objects and their object ids start with the <em>‘^’</em> special symbol.</p>
<p>Here is an example Index definition:</p>
<pre>
    - id: ^hosts.localhost       # index id, must start with a ^ char
      title: "localhost graphs"  # optional - id (sans the ^ char) will be used if not specified
      cols: 6                    # optional (default - the value of $dash-default-cols) how many coulmns of graph images to display
      rows: 10                   # optional (default - the value of $dash-default-rows) how many rows (max) to display. excess rows are paginated
      px: "host.localhost."      # optional filter: rrd object id prefix to match. Ignored if null (which is the default).
      sx: ...                    # optional filter: rrd object id suffix to match. Ignored if null (which is the default).
      rx: ...                    # optional filter: regex to match against rrd object id. Ignored if null (which is the default).
      rxx: ...                   # optional filter: exclude objects which ids match the supplied regex. Ignored if null (which is the default).
      trx: ...                   # optional filter: regex to match against object text representation (including title, var names etc). Ignored if null (which is the default).
      lbls: "foo=bar ..."        $ optional filter: labels filter expression, see below for examples
      agg_op: ...                # optional "aggregate op"
      gb: ...                    # optional "group by" value
      gbp: ...                   # optional "group by param" value
      parent: some.index.id      # optinal parent index id. Indexes without parent are considered top-level
      children:                  # optional list of child index ids to display under this index
        - example.index.id1
        - example.index.id2
        - ...
      alerts:                    # Alerts (and notfications) definitions for objects matching the index filter
        - label: ...             # Individual time series within objects are matched using the "label" property
          alert-crit-gt: ...     # See below for more details
          notify-crit: ...
        - ..
      remote: "*"                # optional - index remote, default is null, use "*" to specify index matching all remotes.
                                 # Individual remote instances can be specified by using their comma-separated ids.
</pre>
<p>Index objects support the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the <strong>index id</strong>: This is the unique index id, starting with the ^ symbol (must not conflict with other index ids).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>title</strong>: - free form text title of the index. If not specified, the id (sans the ^ char) will be used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>desc</strong>: - optional free form text description of the index (displayed together with title on index pages).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>cols</strong>: (default - the value of the $dash-default-cols global) - optional number specifying in how many “columns” to display the rows of graphs. Note that this sets a max limit (and a hard “line break”), chances are that on smaller screens your browser will still wrap graph “rows” as needed for display.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>rows</strong>: (default - the value of the $dash-default-rows global) - optional number specifying how many rows (each having max <em>cols</em> graphs) to display, effectively setting the number of graphs SMG will display on a single page of results.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="period" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>period</strong>: (default - 24h) - a SMG “period string” (or number - in seconds) specifying the displayed graphs time range starting point relative to “now”. The period string format is inspired by <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdfetch.en.html#ITIME_OFFSET_SPECIFICATION">rrdtool time offset</a> (technically it is a subset of it) but you generally set a point in time (relative to now) since which you want to see graphs. It is generally a number followed by an optional single char time specifier which can be one of the following:
<ul>
<li><em>y</em> - for years,</li>
<li><em>m</em> - this is currently used for both minutes and months, If the number is less than 13 it will be considered to be a month otherwise - minutes. Use M to force specifying minutes.</li>
<li><em>d</em> - for days</li>
<li><em>h</em> - for hours</li>
<li><em>M</em> - for minutes</li>
<li>(None, just a number) - assumed to be seconds. The end point of the graphs can be set to be different than “now” by using a “period length” (<strong>pl</strong>) <a href="#graph-options">graph option</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>agg_op</strong>: (default - None) - A SMG aggregate operation string (one of <em>GROUP</em>, <em>STACK</em>, <em>SUM</em>, <em>SUMN</em>, <em>AVG</em>, <em>MAX</em> or <em>MIN</em> ). If that is specified SMG will directly apply the respective <a href="smg.html#concepts-aggregate-functions">aggregate operation</a> to the graphs resulting from the filter, before display.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="group-by" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>gb</strong>: (default - None) - “Group By” value. If set it must be one of the following GB_* values, listed below with their meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li>GB_VARS - By same vars definitions (default)</li>
<li>GB_OBJLBLS - By same object label values. Supports additional optional parameter, see gbp next</li>
<li>GB_VARSSX - By same vars defs and object id suffix</li>
<li>GB_VARSSX2 - By same vars defs and object id suffix (2 levels)</li>
<li>GB_VARSSX3 - By same vars defs and object id suffix (3 levels)</li>
<li>GB_VARSPX - By same vars defs and object id prefix</li>
<li>GB_VARSPX2 - By same vars defs and object id prefix (2 levels)</li>
<li>GB_VARSPX3 - By same vars defs and object id prefix (3 levels)</li>
<li>GB_VARLBLMU - By same vars labels and units</li>
<li>GB_VARLBLMUSX - By same vars labels and units and object id suffix</li>
<li>GB_NUMV - By same number of vars</li>
<li>GB_NUMVSX - By same number of vars and suffix</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>gbp</strong>: (default - None) - “Grup By Param” value - this is only applicable when gb is set to GB_OBJLBLS and is a space separated list of object label names. Graphs having the same object label values for the listed names would be grouped together.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>xagg</strong>: (default - false) - By default, when SMG is executing aggregate operations it will execute them “per-remote” - result will have the aggrgeate graphs split and displayed by the remote instance they “live” in. It is possible to request aggregation across all remotes too - by setting the xagg value to <em>true</em>. Note that this is a relatively expensive operation - SMG has to download all neded remote RRD files to be able to produce a single graph from them so results can be expected to be a bit slower than normally.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>parent</strong>: (default None) - specifying a “parent” index id. Indexes not having a parent id are considered to be “top-level” and are displayed on the main index page (together with their first-level children). If set to some parent id this index will be displayed in the childs list of the parent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>children</strong>: - optional yaml list of strings pointing to other index ids. The indexes pointed by these ids will be displayed as children for this index. Note that the target indexes do not need to have their parent pointed to this index. I.e. an index can have multiple parents that way.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>dhmap</strong> - (TODO) when set to true, SMG will disable (not display) Monitoring heatmap for that index.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>alerts</strong> - alert and notifications configurations defined for all objects matching this index. Check <a href="#monitoring">monitoring configuration</a> for more details.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining index properties represent a Filter with Graph Options. These deserve their own subsections:</p>
<p><a name="filters" /></p>
<h3 id="filter">Filter</h3>
<p>A filter (and its graph options) is configured as part of an index definition using the following properties (along with the rest index properties):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>trx</strong> (Text Regex) - when set, only objects with titles, object ids, graph labels or measurement units matching the specified regular expressions will be matched by the filter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>px</strong> (Prefix) - when set, only object ids having the specified prefix string (starting with it) will be matched by the filter. Note that this is not a regexp but a direct string comparison.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sx</strong> (Suffix) - when set, only object ids having the specified suffix string (ending with it) will be matched by the filter.Note that this is not a regexp but a direct string comparison.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>rx</strong> (Regex) - when set, only object ids matching the specified regular expressions will be matched by the filter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>rxx</strong> (Regex Exclude) - when set, only object ids NOT matching the specified regular expressions will be matched by the filter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>prx</strong> (Parent regex filter) - when set, only object with parent/pre_fetch ids matching the specified regular expressions will be matched by the filter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="filters-lbls" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>lbls</strong> (Labels expression filter) - when set, only objects which have object labels matching the provided label expression will be matched by the filter. Note that object labels are a new feature (and separate from object vars graph display labels). Label expressions can consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>just a label name - in which case object labels having that label name will match regardless of their label value</p></li>
<li><p>label-name=label-value - both the name and the value must mutch</p></li>
<li><p>label-name!=label-value - object must have label with the specified name but value must be different than label-value</p></li>
<li><p>label-name=~label-value - label value is treated as regex and object’s value for the same label must match that.</p></li>
<li><p>label-name!=~label-value - label value is treated as regex and object’s value for the same label must NOT match that.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these can be prepended with an ! to inverse their effect (i.e. whetehr to include or exclude matching objects). The labels filter supports multiple expressions sepaarted by space. This means that spaces in label value filters are not currently supported (as a workaround - use regex and \s).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>remote</strong> (Remote instance, by default - None, meaning local). This should be either set to “*” (quoted in the yaml as the asterisk is special char) which means that this filter should filter across all available remotes or not set at all (meaning “local” filtering). When SMG displays remote index it will automatically populate its value when displaying (note that the “remote” definition is only meaningful in the context of another remote which references the former as some <em>remote id</em>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="graph-options" /></p>
<h3 id="graph-options">Graph options</h3>
<p>The remaining properties represent “Graph Options” - generally specifying some non-default options to display graphs. These are rarely specified in index definitions but more often - come from UI requests.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>step</strong>: (default None, which means automatic) - an integer (in seconds) specifying how many seconds should a data point in the graph represent. This is rarely needed as SMG (rrdtool actually) will pick an optimal step (a.k.a. resolution) depending on the requested period and available RRAs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>pl</strong>: (“period length”, default None) - this is a string or number following SMG <a href="#period">period string</a> format. It sets a time range (length) which we want the produced graphs to cover (still starting at the starting point defined in <strong>period</strong> parameter). So for example you could say “give me graphs starting 24h (period param) ago and covering 6h (pl param)”. Note that this is rarely as useful as it may seem at first sight. As time passes older RRD/RRA data gets averaged and loses detail, so if you decide that you want a graph covering 6h but starting a year ago, chances are that you will see flat horizontal lines representing the average values for the object vars for the given 6 hours.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>dpp</strong>: (disable period-over-period, default false) - by default SMG will plot two lines for every var in the graph - one (solid) for the values in the period and another (same color but dotted) - for the values covering the previous period (of same size). If desired one can disable that behavior by setting dpp to <em>true</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>d95p</strong>: (disable 95%-ile ruler, default false) - by default SMG will plot a horisontal flat line (“ruler”) at the calculated maximum 95%-ile value (basically, removing the top-5% values, considered outliers). If desired one can disable the plotting of that line by setting d95p value to <em>true</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>maxy</strong>: (maximum Y-value, default None) - a number setting a hard max limit on the Y-axis value of the displayed graphs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>xsort</strong>: (integer, default 0) - When different than 0 SMG will treat that as a request to sort the outputted (on the page) graphs by the average value of the var which (1-based) index is equal to xsort. E.g set to 1 to sort by the first variable, 2 for the second etc. Graphs which have less variables than the requested xsort index will remain unsorted. Sorting is also described <a href="smg.html#concepts-sorting">here</a>. Note that sorting applies after grouping compatible graphs together which can be controlled using the <a href="#group-by">gb param</a>. Setting xsort to -1 will only group the graphs together but without any sorting within the groups.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="hindexes" /></p>
<h2 id="hidden-indexes">Hidden Indexes</h2>
<p>Only difference in defining a hidden index from a regular one is that it has a ‘~’ character in the beginning of the index object id (instead of ‘^’) and the only difference in behavior is that the hidden one is not displayed on the index page(s).</p>
<p>Currently hidden indexes are only useful in the context of monitoring - to define a group of objects for which in turn to define alert thresholds, but not necessarily clutter the main page with all of the groups.</p>
<p><a name="notify-command"></p>
<h2 id="notification-commands">Notification commands</h2>
<p>The notify-command object defines a named command object to be executed for delivery of alert notifications (can have many of those). The command id can then be referenced as “recipient” in notify-{crit/warn/spike} object/index or global definitions. Example notify-command definitions, together with globals referencing them:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
- type: notify-command
  id: mail-people
  command: "smgscripts/notif-mail.sh 'asen@smule.com somebodyelse@smule.com' "

- type: notify-command
  id: pagerduty
  command: "smgscripts/notif-pagerduty.sh"

- $notify-crit: mail-people,pagerduty
- $notify-warn: mail-people
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual command gets executed with the following variables set by SMG in the child process environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>$SMG_ALERT_SEVERITY - one of RECOVERY, ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, ANOMALY, WARNING, FAILED, CRITICAL, SMGERR, THROTTLED, UNTHROTTLED</li>
<li>$SMG_ALERT_KEY - the affected object/var, pre-fetch or global issue identification string.</li>
<li>$SMG_ALERT_SUBJECT - the “subject” for the message to be sent</li>
<li>$SMG_ALERT_BODY - the “body” of the message to be sent</li>
</ul>
<p>Check smgscripts/notif-mail.sh for an example of how this could work</p>
<p><a name="monitoring" /></p>
<h2 id="monitoring-configuration">Monitoring configuration</h2>
<p>Every object variable (mapping to a graph line) can have zero or more alert configurations applied. Each alert config is a key -&gt; value pair where the key is a special keyword recognized by SMG and the value usually represents some alert threshold. Currently the following alert keywords are defined:</p>
<pre>
    alert-warn: NUM      # same as alert-warn-gte
    alert-warn-gte: NUM  # warning alert if value greater than or equal to NUM
    alert-warn-gt: NUM   # warning alert if value greater than NUM
    alert-warn-lte: NUM  # warning alert if value is less than or equal to NUM
    alert-warn-lt: NUM   # warning alert if value is less than NUM
    alert-warn-eq: NUM   # warning alert if value is equal to NUM
    alert-warn-neq: NUM  # warning alert if value is equal to NUM
    alert-crit: NUM      # same as alert-crit-gte
    alert-crit-gte: NUM  # critical alert if value greater than or equal to NUM
    alert-crit-gt: NUM   # critical alert if value greater than NUM
    alert-crit-lte: NUM  # critical alert if value is less than or equal to NUM
    alert-crit-lt: NUM   # critical alert if value is less than NUM
    alert-crit-eq: NUM   # critical alert if value is equal to NUM
    alert-crit-neq: NUM   # critical alert if value is equal to NUM
    alert-p-_pluginId_-_checkId_: # configure a plugin-implemented check for the value
</pre>
<p>The built-in “mon” plugin implements the following three checks</p>
<pre>
  alert-p-mon-anom: "" # anomaly alert - detecting unusual spikes or drops
                       #   it accepts a string with 3 values separated by ":"
                       #   the default value (when empty string is provided) is
                       #   "1.5:30m:30h" which means 1.5 (relative) change
                       #   in the last 30 minutes period compared to the previous
                       #   30h period.

  alert-p-mon-pop: ... # period over period value check - detecting if the current
                       #   value has changed with certain thresholds over the same value
                       #   some period ago. It accepts a string with 4 values separated
                       #   by ":".
                       #   The first value is a period and an optional resolution
                       #   separated by "-". E.g. "24h-1M" means compare with value 24 hrs
                       #   ago over a 1 minute average. If the -1M part is omitted the
                       #   object interval will be used as resolution (that would be the
                       #   highest available resolution in the RRD file).
                       #   The second value is the comparison operator - one of lt(e),
                       #   gt(e) or eq.
                       #   The third and fourth values are the warning and critical
                       #   thresholds of change.
                       #   E.g. to define an warning alert if some value drops below 0.7
                       #   from yesterday and a critical alert if the value drops below 0.5
                       #   from yesterday, at a 5min-average resolution, one can use the
                       #   following config string: "24h-5M:lt:0.7:0.5"
                       #   Both warning and critical thresholds are optional, e.g. use
                       #   something like "24h:lt:0.7" to set only a warning threshold and
                       #   something like "24h:lt::0.5" to set only critical threshold.

                       #   separated via *. The time of day is defined as a start and end (separated
                       #   by -) hour and minute (separated by _). The check can only trigger alerts
                       #   when the current time is within the time of day (if specified) and day of
                       #   week/month (if specified)
</pre>
<p>Check <a href="smg.html#concepts-anomaly">here</a> for more details on how alert-p-mon-anom/anomaly detection works.</p>
<p>In addition to alert-* properties one can also define the following notify- settings, specifying a list of “recipients” ($notify-command ids) to be exectuted on “hard” errors (and recoveries) at the appropriate severity level (crit/warn/spike), the special “notify-disable” flag explicitly disabling notifications for the applicable object var or the notify-backoff value specifying at what interval non-recovered object alert notifications should be re-sent. The notify-strikes value determines how many consecutive error states to be considered a hard error and in turn - trigger alert notifications.</p>
<pre><code>notify-crit: notify-cmd-id-1,notify-cmd-id-2,...
# (notify-fail is not relevant for var states)
notify-fail: notify-cmd-id-1,notify-cmd-id-2,...
notify-warn: notify-cmd-id-1,notify-cmd-id-2,...
notify-anom: notify-cmd-id-1,notify-cmd-id-2,...
notify-disable: true
notify-backoff: 6h
notify-strikes: 3</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to disable fetch error notifications for given object one must set “<em>notify-disable: true</em>” at the object level. Pre-fetch commands support notify-disable too.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When multiple conflicting notify-strikes values apply, SMG will use the minimal from these. When multiple conflicting notify-backoff values apply, SMG will use the maximal from these. Any applicable notify-disable set to true will result in disabled notifications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently there are two ways to apply alert/notify configs to any given object variable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inline with the object variable as part of the variable definition properties. E.g the following will define thresholds for two variable labelled sl1min and sl5min with values 10/8 which if exceeded will generate a “warning” alert. The sl5min one will also trigger the (defined elsewhere) notify-command with id mail-on-warn where the sl1min value will not trigger notification commands.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
  ...
  vars:
    - label: sl1min
      ...
      alert-warn-gt: 10
      notify-disable: true
    - label: sl5min
      ...
      alert-warn-gt: 8
      notify-warn: mail-on-warn
      notify-backoff: 1h
</pre>
<ul>
<li>As part of indexes (including hidden indexes) under the special alerts property. Examples:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
  ...
  notify-fail: ...
  notify-strikes: 5
  alerts:
   - label: sl1min   # any objects matching the index filter but also variables having the sl1min label
     alert-warn-gt: 3
     notify-warn: mail-on-warn
     alert-crit-gt: 8
     notify-crit: mail-on-crit
   - label: 1         # when number - it will be used as a 0-based index in the variables array
     alert-warn-gt: 3
     alert-crit-gt: 8
   - label: iowait
     alert-p-mon-anom: ""
</pre>
<p>The alerts property is an array of yaml objects each specifying a “label” and one or more alert thresholds or notify- properties. If the label is an integer number it will be interpreted as an index in the list of variables of the objects matching the index filter. For example one can define default anomaly (spike/drop) detection on all objects using the following config (just add more alerts defs if there are objects with more than 8 vars):</p>
<pre>
- ~all.alert.spikes:
  # empty filter means match all
  alerts:
    - label: 0
      alert-p-mon-anom: ""
    - label: 1
      alert-p-mon-anom: ""
    - label: 2
      alert-p-mon-anom: ""
    - label: 3
      alert-p-mon-anom: ""
    - label: 4
      alert-p-mon-anom: ""
    - label: 5
      alert-p-mon-anom: ""
    - label: 6
      alert-p-mon-anom: ""
    - label: 7
      alert-p-mon-anom: ""
</pre>
<p><a name="remote" /></p>
<h2 id="remote-smg-instances">Remote SMG instances</h2>
<p>A $remote defines an unique remote <strong>id</strong> and an <strong>url</strong> at which the remote SMG instance is accessible. Here is an example remote definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
- type: remote
  id: another-dc
  url: "http://smg.dc2.company.com:9080"
# slave_id: dc1
# graph_timeout_ms: 30000
# config_fetch_timeout_ms: 300000
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If the optional <strong>slave_id</strong> parameter is provided it indicates that this instance is a “worker” in the context of that remote. Its value must be the id under this instance is configured on the “master”. A slave instance will not load and display the relevant remote instance config and graphs but will only notify it on its own config changes.</p>
<p>One can run a setup where the “main” instance (can be two of them, for redundancy) has multiple remotes configured where the remote instances only have the “main” one as configured (for them) remote (with slave_id set). With such setup one only needs a single “beefy” (more mem) “main” instance which will hold all available across the remotes objects and the other ones will only keep theirs.</p>
<p>The <strong>graph_timeout_ms</strong> and <strong>config_fetch_timeout_ms</strong> values allow one to override the global timeouts for garph/monitor state API calls and config fetch (which can be much slower)</p>
<p><a name="rra_def" /></p>
<h2 id="custom-rra-definitions">Custom RRA definitions</h2>
<p>Whenever rrdtool creates a new rrd file it must get a set of definitions for Round Robin Archives ( RRAs, explained better <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/tut/rrd-beginners.en.html">here</a> ). A rra_def has an <strong>id</strong> and a list of RRA definitions under the <strong>rra</strong> key. The actual RRA definitions are strings and defined using rrdtool syntax. Here is how the default SMG RRA for 1 minute interval would look like if defined as $rra_def:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
- type: rra_def
  id: smg_1m
  rra:
    - "RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:5760"
    - "RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:5:1152"
    - "RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:30:1344"
    - "RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:120:1440"
    - "RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:360:5840"
    - "RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1440:1590"
    - "RRA:MAX:0.5:1:5760"
    - "RRA:MAX:0.5:5:1152"
    - "RRA:MAX:0.5:30:1344"
    - "RRA:MAX:0.5:120:1440"
    - "RRA:MAX:0.5:360:5840"
    - "RRA:MAX:0.5:1440:1590"
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that normally one does not need to define or use any $rra_def objects, the defaults which SMG will pick would work just fine for most of the cases (these have been inspired by mrtg/cacti). Still there are some use cases where one wants to use different RRAs - e.g. keep some important graphs at higher resolutions for longer period (the draw-back being a bigger RRD file size).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="globals" /></p>
<h2 id="globals">Globals</h2>
<p>Global for SMG variables are defined as a name -&gt; value pairs where the name is prefixed with ‘$’ sign. Here is the list of supported global variables, together with their default values (all of these are optional):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>$rrd_dir</strong>: <em>“smgrrd”</em> - directory where to store your rrd files. You probably want to change this on any production installation (for more demanding setups, may want to put that dir on an SSD drive). That dir must be writabe by the SMG user. This must be defined before object definitions in the config.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrd_dir_levels</strong>: <em>None</em> - if set, it has to be a list of numbers separated with ‘:’ symbol (e.g. “1:1”). In that case SMG will create and use sub-dir levels under rrd_dir (one level per list item) using the MD5 hash value of the object id and respective number of bytes (for each level) from that hash as hex strings. Useful if want to keep track of hundreds of thousands of rrds where having them all in one dir could be a problem on some systems. Only set this once (attempt to set it second time in the config will be ignored). WARNING: Never change the value once you have rrds created, you will lose the data if you do so.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$dash-default-cols</strong>: <em>6</em> - How many “columns” of graphs to display on the dashboard by default. SMG will insert a new line between graphs at that “column”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$dash-default-rows</strong>: <em>10</em> - How many “rows” of graphs to display on the dashboard by default. This together with the number of “columns” determines the “page size” - how many graphs will be displayed on each graphs page.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$auto-refresh-interval</strong>: <em>300</em> - page auto refresh interval (if enabled by default or via the UI). Set to 0 to completely disable auto-refresh.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$default-auto-refresh</strong>: <em>true</em> - whether by default dashboard pages will reload automatically. This can be toggled on per page basis in the UI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$default-interval</strong> - <em>60</em> - default update interval for objects not specifying it. This must be defined in the config before object definitions lacking interval setting (and one can specify it multiple times, changing the value for subequently defined objects) if one wants to change it from the default.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$default-timeout</strong> - <em>30</em> - default timeout for object fetch commands (when retrieving data for updates) not specifying it. This must be defined in the config before object definitions lacking interval setting (and one can specify it multiple times, changing the value for subequently defined objects) if one wants to change it from the default.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="img_dir" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>$img_dir</strong>: <em>“public/smg”</em> - where to output the graphed images. That dir must be writabe by the SMG user.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$url_prefix</strong>: <em>“/assets/smg”</em> - what is the base url path under which the image files will be accessible by the browser</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrd_cache_dir</strong>: <em>“smgrrd”</em> - sometimes (when wanting to graph an image from multiple rrd files residing on diff remotes) SMG needs to download the actual rrd files locally. These rrd files are stored under the $rrd_cache_dir value. That dir must be writabe by the SMG user.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrd_tool</strong>: <em>rrdtool</em> - the rrdtool command to use. Can specify full path if the version of rrdtool you want to use is not on the default PATH.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="rrd_socket" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>$rrd_socket</strong>: - <em>(default is None)</em>. Otherwise one can specify a string value like unix:/path/to/socket.file. If specified it will be passed to the relevant rrdtool update, graph or fetch commands with the –daemon unix:/path/to/socket.file option. This in turn is intended for use with rrdcached (a rrdtool daemon used for doing updates more efficiently). rrdcached is highly recommended on more demanding setups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrdcached_update_batch_size</strong>: - <em>1</em> - if set to more than 1 and $rrd_socket is specified SMG will batch updates (with batch size of the value) and use socat and rrdcached protocol directly for even more efficient updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrdcached_socat_command</strong>: - <em>socat</em> - the socat command to use when flushing batched writes. By default SMG will use <em>socat</em> and expect it to be in the executables PATH.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrdcached_flush_all_on_run</strong>: - <em>false</em> - whether to send FLUSHALL to rrdcached at the end of every run (only used when doing batched updates via rrdcached protocol)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrdcached_flush_on_read</strong>: - <em>true</em> - whether to send FLUSH <em>file</em> to rrdcached before every read - fetch or graph (only used when doing batched updates via rrdcached protocol). Either this or $rrdcached_flush_all_on_run should be set to true in rrdcached batch update mode. Setting both to true can hurt efficiency and setting both to false would result in retrieving possibly stale data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrd_graph_width</strong>: <em>607</em> - the graph width passed to rrdtool when graphing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrd_graph_height</strong>: <em>152</em> - the graph height passed to rrdtool when graphing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrd_graph_font</strong>: <em>“DEFAULT:0:monospace”</em> - the graph font string passed to rrdtool when graphing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrd_graph_dppp</strong>: <em>3</em> <em>(advanced)</em> - how many data points are represented in a singe “width” pixel. Used to estimate displayed graph resolution (step)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrd_graph_dppi</strong>: <em>None</em> <em>(advanced)</em> - how many data points can be represented in a singe image. If this is set <strong>$rrd_graph_dppp</strong> is ignored. Used to estimate displayed graph resolution/step</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrd_graph_padding</strong>: <em>83</em> <em>(advanced)</em> - the padding (in pixels) rrdtool adds to the configured <strong>$rrd_graph_width</strong> for the resulting image size. Used to estimate html cell widths.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$rrd_max_args_len</strong>: <em>25000</em> <em>(advanced)</em> - The maximum length of a rrdtool command. If a resulting command exceeds that the rrdtool arguments will be passed via stdin instead of command-line args as it is by default.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$monlog_dir</strong>: <em>“monlog”</em> - the directory where the monitoring system saves logs with events in json format (one file per calendar date).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$monstate_dir</strong>: <em>“monstate”</em> - the directory where the monitoring system saves its memory state on shut down.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$include</strong>: <em>(no default value)</em> “path/to/some/*.yml” - whenever the SMG config parser encounters an $include global it will interpret its value as a filesystem “glob” (and possibly expand that to multiple files) and then process each of the files yielded from the glob as regular config files (these can have more $includes too)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$search-max-levels</strong>: <em>10</em> - how many levels (of dotted tokens) to support in autocomplete. Lower to 2-3 or less if you run a cluster with hundreds of thousands of objects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="index-tree-levels"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$index-tree-levels</strong>: <em>1</em> - How many levels of indexes to display by default on the Configured Indexes page. The default value of 1 means to display only top level indexes, 2 would also display their children etc. Valid values are between 1 and 5.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="run-tree-levels"></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>$run-tree-levels-display</strong>: <em>1</em> - Same as $index-tree-levels but applies to monitor state run trees. How many levels of fetch commands to display by default on the top level Run trees page.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$max-url-size</strong>: <em>8000</em> - The maximum url size supported by browsers. SMG will use POST requests (instead of GET) if a filter URL would exceed that size. Only draw back is that the resulting URLs will not be shareable. This needs to be set to around 2000 for IE support, and can be raised to 32k if one does not care about Android and IE.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$remote-graph-timeout-ms</strong>: 30000 (30 sec) - default timeout when requesting graphs (and monitor states) from remote instances. Can be overridon in each remote definition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$remote-config-fetch-timeout-ms</strong>: 300000 (5 min) - default imeout when fetching remote config. These can be big so normally thats much higher than the graph timeout value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$reload-slave-remotes</strong>: <em>“false”</em> - By default SMG will only notify “master” remote instances (ones defined with slave_id property). One can override this behavior and make it notify slave instances too by setting this to “true”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$proxy-disable</strong>: <em>“false”</em> - by default SMG will link to remote images via its /proxy/&lt;remote-id&gt;/&lt;path-to-image&gt;.png URL which in turn will proxy the request to the actual remote SMG instance. This behavior can be disabled by setting the $proxy-disable value to “true”. In that case the end-user will need direct access to the respective remote instances.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that in production setups where there is already a reverse proxy serving the static images directly it is recommended to keep $proxy-disable to “false” (same as omitting it) and then to intercept the /proxy/&lt;remote-id&gt; URLs at the reverse proxy and proxy these directly to the respective SMG instances (at their root URL) instead of hitting the local SMG one for proxying. Here is how an example reverse proxy configuration for apache could look like for a remote named “<em>some-dc</em>” where SMG is running on <em>smg1.some-dc.myorg.com</em> and listening on port 9080 (possibly another reverse proxy there):</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>
        ProxyPass        /proxy/some-dc  http://smg1.some-dc.myorg.com:9080/
        ProxyPassReverse /proxy/some-dc  http://smg1.some-dc.myorg.com:9080/
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Check the <a href="#running">Running and troubleshooting</a> section for more details on reverse proxy setup in production.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>$proxy-timeout</strong>: <em>30000</em> - this option can be used to adjust the proxy requests timeout (when these are handled by SMG and not the reverse proxy in front).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$notify-global</strong>: a comma separated list of $notify-command ids, to be executed on any global SMG errors (usually - overlaps)</p></li>

<h2 id="custom-dashboards-configuration">Custom dashboards configuration</h2>
<p>Custom dashboards are defined in the yaml configuration using an object of type <strong>cdash</strong>.</p>
<p>The cdash object is a yaml map which must have an unique <strong>id</strong> property, an optional <strong>title</strong> and a list of <strong>items</strong> of various types. All item types have some common set of properties - an unique <strong>id</strong>, an optional <strong>title</strong>, <strong>width</strong> and <strong>height</strong> properties. The other mandatory propert is the <strong>type</strong> which can be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>IndexGraphs</em> - the graphs produced by some defined in smg index. This item type requires an <strong>ix</strong> property specifying the index id. It also supports <strong>offset</strong> and <strong>limit</strong> properties in the list of graphs (default is to show all).</p></li>
<li><p><em>IndexStates</em> - svg heatmaps representing index states. Indexes are specified using the <strong>ixes</strong> propery which is a list of index ids. The svg image width is specified via the <strong>img_width</strong> property.</p></li>
<li><p><em>MonitorProblems</em> - current problems as visible on the monitor page. Supports customizing what is displayed using <strong>ms</strong> (minimum alert level) filter and also <strong>soft</strong> and <strong>slncd</strong> filter flags.</p></li>
<li><p><em>MonitorLog</em> - recent monitor/log entries. Supports customizing what is displayed using <strong>ms</strong> (minimum alert level) filter and also <strong>soft</strong> and <strong>slncd</strong> filter flags.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Plugin</em> - plugins can implement custom dashboard items and using custom (plugin-specific) configuration.</p></li>
<li><p><em>External</em> - and external web page displayed in an iframe. Requires an <strong>url</strong> parameter and a separate <strong>fheight</strong> (frame height) property from the standard <strong>height</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Container</em> - this is a special type of item which is a container for other items specified as a list under the <strong>items</strong> property.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>cc</strong> - “Common Commands” plugin, exposes commands to use in the regular object commands. Subcommands:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>:cc csv</p>
<pre>
 :cc csv parse [parse opts] [format]
   -d|--delim &lt;char> (default ',')
   -nh|--no-header  - csv has no header row
   -sh|--strict-header - if set parse will abort on duplicate or missing header forgiven column
   -h|--headers hdr1,hdr2,...  - set custom header names based on position
  [format] (default - DEFAULT) - apache commons csv pre-defined format name (e.g. EXCEL)

 :cc csv get [get opts] &lt;row selectors (k=v)> &lt;val selectors>
   -e0|--empty-as-0 - if set non existing/empty values will return "0.0"
   -eN|--empty-as-nan - if set non existing/empty values will return "NaN"
  &lt;row selectors> - col1=val1 col2=val2
     col is either a number (0-based column index) or a column header name
     val is the value which the row must have in the respective column
       if val starts with '~' it will be treated as regex
       if val start with '!' the mathc is inverted (i.e. the row must not have that value)
       use !~... for negative regex match
  &lt;val selectors> - list of zero-based column indexes or column header names
  In both cases if a column header name is a number it can be "quoted" in the definition so
  that it is not treated as column index

 :cc csv pget [get opts]

  separated by space. 0 means to output the entire input line
  </pre></li>
<li><p>:cc map</p>
<pre>
  :cc map k1=v1 k2=v2 [default]
    map input lines (kX string values) to specified output values (vX string values)

<li><p>:cc rpn</p>
<pre>
  :cc rpn &lt;expr1> &lt;expr2...>
   treat input as update data (list of Doubles) and compute RPN expressions from them
   input ines are mapped to $dsX values in the expression where X is the zero-based
   index in the list. Output one result (Double) per RPN expression provided
  </pre></li>
<li><p>:cc rx.. - in all cases &lt;regex&gt; can be quoted using single quotes, double quotes, ‘|’ or ‘/’.</p>
<ul>
<li>:cc rxm
<pre>

  provided via the -d|--default flag value it will be outputted. Result
  will be error otherwise.
  </pre></li>
<li>:cc rxml
<pre>
  :cc rxml [-d|--default 'value'] &lt;regex>
  returns individual matching lines. error if no default value is provided
  and no matching lines (like grep). If a default value is provided (via
  the -d or --default option value) - it will be returned with success response.
  </pre></li>
<li>:cc rxe
<pre>
  :cc rxe &lt;regex_with_match_groups> &lt;mgrpoupIdx1> &lt;mgrpoupIdx2>
  apply the regex on the entire input (as a string, possibly with new lines) and print
  each match group on a separate line
  </pre></li>
<li>:cc rxel
<pre>
  :cc rxel &lt;regex_with_match_groups> &lt;mgrpoupIdx1> &lt;mgrpoupIdx2>
  apply the regex on each input line separately and print each line's match groups on one line
  separated by space

<h3 id="scrape-plugin">Scrape Plugin</h3>
<p>Note: The automatic config generation from scrape plugin is now deprecated. AutoConf and its openmetrics template essentially replace that in a more consistent manner.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>scrape</strong> - Plugin to natively handle metrics exposed in OpenMetrics (Prometehus) format. See smgconf/scrape-plugin.yml for example target configuration (the local SMG instance). The Scrape plugin implements SMG objects config generation based on Prometheus/OpenMetrics URL (or data). So (just like Prometheus) it is possible to configure only scrape targets (/metrcis URLs) and the included stats will be auto discovered by SMG. Scrape needs a SMG conf output dir which it can manage (add/remove confs) if told to do so. That directory MUST be included by the regular SMG conf (/etc/smg/config.yml). This is the case with the “official” docker image/config. Scrape defines the following plugin commands (used by the generated SMG conf):
<ul>
<li>:scrape http <url> - a plain http(s) call to GET a http response from the provided url, can also be done with curl instead. This command accepts two options:
<ul>
<li>:scrape http :secure <url> - by default it will ignore ssl cert errors unless :secure is specified.</li>
<li>:scrape http :tokenf /path/to/token_file <url> - the contents of the token_file will be used as an “Authorization: Bearer <token>” value. Useful when deployed in k8s and need to access protected resources for monitoring via ServiceAccount</li>
</ul></li>
<li>:scrape parse - parse the output of an :http (or curl) command into internal representation. Must be defined as a child of a command outputting metrcis data (text), so in theory it doesn’t <em>have</em> to be retreived over HTTP. The internal representation converts all metrics (lines) to a map of key -&gt; value pairs where the key is generated from the metrics name and all labels (these have to be unique for Prometheus to work too). Also check :scrape get below.</li>
<li>:scrape fetch [:secure] [:tokenf /path/to/token_file] <url> - a combined :http and :parse command - get the metrics URL and parse the data in one shot. Fetch supports the same :secure and :tokenf options and also requires an URL argument</li>
<li>:scrape get <uid1> [<uid2>…] - retrieve a value from parsed OpenMetrics stats. Must be defined as a child of either a :fetch or a :parse command. The uids are generated at parse time and are predictable - it represents the metric name and all labels key/values appended to it and separated by dots. “Unsafe” SMG object id characters are converted to underscore. In te unlikely case of id conflict after that conversion is done the conflicting uids will have an additional ._N suffix where N is the position of the object in the list of conflicting uids.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>e.g. alert-p-mon-pop: “24h-5m:lt:0.7” - check the short_per (5m) average value against the same value long_per (24h) ago, and compare the difference (proportion) using the provided op (lt, can be lt, lte, gt, gte) against the configured warning (0.7) and optional critical thresholds</li>
