<h1 id="how-to-monitor-linux-nodes">How to monitor Linux Nodes</h1>
<p>SMG can monitor hosts using either SNMP or <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter">node_exporter</a> as host agents from which to poll stats.</p>
<p>The SNMP template is older and its origins come from some (old) <a href="https://www.cacti.net/">cacti</a> Linux server templates. The node_exporter one is more recent but both aim to represent similar/the same stats as exposed by the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>These would include stats like sysload, cpu usage of the various types (stacked on top with a sum equal to 100 x number of cores), interrupts/context switches, memory usage, block device i/o, network i/o, network established/new connections and disk usage.</p>
<p>By default these will add a top-level ICMP “ping” command which acts like a host up/down check (can be overriden via a “add_ping: false” context variable). Then the actual stats fetching commands would be children of that ping command.</p>
<p>The setup details are slightly different depending on the monitoring agent used (node_exporter or SNMP).</p>
<h2 id="using-node-exporter">Using Node Exporter</h2>
<p>This is becoming standard these days partially because of the ease of setup and access over well supported protocol like HTTP.</p>
<p>The install instructions would be distribution dependend but chances are that there are packages available for the more popular distributions. E.g. on RedHat-compatible systems one can do the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo yum -y install epel-release
$ sudo yum -y install golang-github-prometheus-node-exporter

$ sudo systemctl start node_exporter
$ sudo systemctl enable node_exporter</code></pre>
<p>Then verify that the /metrics URL is accessible from the SMG isntance on the node exporter port:</p>
<pre><code>(docker exec smg) curl -f -sS http://%node_host%:9100/metrics</code></pre>
<p>If you see the metrics output the system is good to be monitored by SMG. We can do this by adding the following configuration (assuming a node name of www1.host with an IP address 192.168.10.101):</p>
<pre><code>cat &gt;&gt; /opt/smg/data/conf/autoconf.d/www1.host.yml &lt;&lt;-EOH

- output: www1.host-.yml
  template: node-exporter
  node_name: www1.host
  node_host: 192.168.10.101 # or set resolve_name: true if reslovable by DNS      
  runtime_data: true
  runtime_data_timeout_sec: 30
  command: &quot;curl -sS -f &#39;http://%node_host%:9100/metrics&#39;&quot;
  # XXX May have to supply net_dvc_filters context param to filter the correct interfaces we care about
  # context:
  #   net_dvc_filters:
  #     - node_network_up=1
  #     - node_network_address_assign_type=2
EOH</code></pre>
<p>Then reload SMG conf as described <a href="Run_smg.html">here</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/asen/smg/blob/master/smgconf/ac-templates/node-exporter.yml.ssp">node-exporter template</a> can be tweaked using context params.</p>
<p>By default it will add a top-level ping command against the node_host for a host up/down check. This can be disabled by providing an “add_ping: false” context parameter.</p>
<p>Check the context variables at the top of the temlate source for all currently supported options (TODO: document these here)</p>
