- Smule Grapher (SMG) -
=================================

-- What is this --

* Play 2.4/scala (https://www.playframework.com/) app using external scripts to fetch
numbers from services and rrdtool (http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/) to maintain many
databases and display graphs from them. It can also do a lot more than that - like
checking the fetched valules against pre-configured thresholds and/or anomalies and
sending alerts. It is also possible to extend it via plugins (scala extensions).

Intended to be a simple to maintain but scalable monitoring system for people who
prefer to generate their configs over clicking on UI to set it up.

Check the docs for more information.

-- Build --

    $ git clone git@github.com:asen/smg.git
    $ cd smg
    $ ./build-smg.sh
    ...
    *** Done. Output in target/universal/smg-0.3.tgz

-- Install and configure --

0. Install prerequisites (e.g on linux):

  # yum install rrdtool

(these below are for the default conf to work on linux against localhost)

  # yum install net-snmp net-snmp-util
  # cp /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.bck && echo "rocommunity public localhost" > /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
  # /etc/init.d/snmpd start

1. Unpack tgz

2. Copy example config (good for linux) into /etc/smg/config.yml

   # mkdir /etc/smg && cp smg-0.3/smgconf/config-example.yml /etc/smg/config.yml

3. Point JAVA_HOME to a Java 8 installation

4. Start SMG using the start-smg.sh script:

   # ./start-smg.sh

5. Point your browser to localhost:9000 (localhost:9000/assets/docs/index.html for documentation (replace
localhost with the host where SMG was installed).


-- Development setup (Mac) --

1. Install JDK 8.
2. Install from brew:

    $ brew install rrdtool coreutils

2. Run:

    $ cd smg
    $ JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8) ./activator run

3. Install coreutils for gtimeout (brew install coreutils) and change application.conf:

    # Use smg.timeoutCommand to override the timeout command
    # executable (e.g. gtimeout on mac with homebrew)
    smg.timeoutCommand = "gtimeout"
