- Smule Grapher (SMG) -
=================================

-- What is this --

* Play 2.4/scala (https://www.playframework.com/) app using external scripts to fetch
numbers from services and rrdtool (http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/) to maintain many
databases and display graphs from them. It can also do a lot more than that - like
checking the fetched valules against pre-configured thresholds and/or anomalies and
sending alerts. It is also possible to extend it via plugins (scala extensions).

Intended to be a simple to maintain but scalable monitoring system for people who
prefer to generate their configs over clicking on UI to set it up.

Check the docs for more information.
