v 0.5+

== General Enhancements ==

* support agg and graph objects defined before their ref objects (?)

* configurator (plugin?)

* support external updates - objects which do not have an external command to execute but get the updates
from external sources posting the data via some API. Probably a plugin.

* filter to hide empty graphs (?)

* support "tags" (?) - be able to filter by tag.

* backups/replication (?) Currently can just copy out the rrd dir for a backup (and the conf - if not generated).

* login system (?)


== Monitor ==

* combine UNKNOWN alerts for the same fetch command from diff intervals into a single one.

== Search ==

* smart (?) search

== Documentation ==

* document JMX plugin config

== Known Bugs ==

* GROUP-ing stacked graphs seems messed up

* prevent saveStateToDisk when shutdown is already in progress
