v 1.2+

== Short term plan ==

* stable release
* handle kube-state-metrics in Kube plugin (not really metrics)
* per-recipient throttling of alerts
* retry individual failed notifications commands not only when all fail

== Documentation ==

* document JMX plugin commands
* document event log and UI
* documnet kube and scrape plugins
* document label filters

== Known Bugs ==

* merging index filter with backslash strips it

* GROUP-ing stacked graphs seems messed up ?

== Random longer term possibilities ==

* support providing custom fetch consolidation function? (vs always using AVERAGE) ?

* slave mode - do not do RRD updates but forward to central update node ?

* backups/replication (?) Currently can just copy out the rrd dir for a backup (and the conf - if not generated).

* login system (?)

* support external updates - objects which do not have an external command to execute but get the updates
from external sources posting the data via some API. Probably a plugin.

* fix/improve x-sort (how?)

* configurator (plugin?)

* filter to hide empty graphs (?)

* Silencing indexes so that newly added objects will be treated as silenced (already covered by sticky silence?)
