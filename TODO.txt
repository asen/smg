v 0.6+

== Short term plan ==

* More context in alerts
* Monitor check plugins:
  - check value for change over period

== Documentation ==

* document JMX plugin config
* document event log and UI

== Known Bugs ==

* GROUP-ing stacked graphs seems messed up

== Random longer term possibilities ==

* slave mode - do not do RRD updates but forward to central update node ?

* backups/replication (?) Currently can just copy out the rrd dir for a backup (and the conf - if not generated).

* login system (?)

* support external updates - objects which do not have an external command to execute but get the updates
from external sources posting the data via some API. Probably a plugin.

* fix/improve x-sort (how?)

* configurator (plugin?)

* filter to hide empty graphs (?)

* support "tags" (?) - be able to filter by tag.

* Silencing indexes so that newly added objects will be treated as silenced (already covered by sticky silence?)
