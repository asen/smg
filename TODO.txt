v 0.5+

== General Enhancements ==

* Support update "delay", for stats which we get with certain delay.

* Improve event log and UI

* support external updates - objects which do not have an external command to execute but get the updates
from external sources posting the data via some API. Probably a plugin.

* fix/improve x-sort (how?)

* configurator (plugin?)

* filter to hide empty graphs (?)

* support "tags" (?) - be able to filter by tag.

== Monitor ==

* combine UNKNOWN alerts for the same fetch command from diff intervals into a single one.

== Documentation ==

* document JMX plugin config

== Known Bugs ==

* GROUP-ing stacked graphs seems messed up

* prevent saveStateToDisk when shutdown is already in progress

== Longer term ==

* slave mode - do not do RRD updates but forward to central update node ?

* backups/replication (?) Currently can just copy out the rrd dir for a backup (and the conf - if not generated).

* login system (?)
